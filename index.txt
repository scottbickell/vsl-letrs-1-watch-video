LETRS Empowers Reading Teachers’ Delivery of Critical Instructional Tools

Dear %%first_name%%,

Learning to read is a complex skill and teaching reading can be a challenging process. Teachers benefit from professional development based on the science of how reading and language work together to build strong literacy skills.

LETRS (Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling), authored by renowned literacy experts Dr. Louisa Moats and Dr. Carol Tolman, is an evidence-based solution that prepares educators with the skills they need to be effective teachers of reading.
